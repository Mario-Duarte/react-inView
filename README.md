## Why?

As a long user of jQuery I have developed many plugins over the years that have helped me developing solutions faster and more reliably. As I move and transition to React(â™¥) I wanted some of these to come along with me on this new journey.

I like my plugins(now components/hooks) to be as flexible as possible and to not get in the way of the styling of the app/site that is been implemented to and this is no different.

Want to come along on this journey and/or have some great ideas on how to improve this Hook? [Check out the repo here!](https://github.com/Mario-Duarte/react-inView)
